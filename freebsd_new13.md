# What's New in FreeBSD 13.0
Released on April 13th 2021, 13.0 is the culmination of two years of hard work and showcases a shift in focus towards the future of FreeBSD. From changes in architecture and the removal of legacy tooling to faster systems and subsystems, the Project’s commitment towards looking at the future of FreeBSD is in motion!

Highlights from the new release include:
* Exciting TLS in the Kernel developments to maximize performance 
* Great improvements were made in the graphics stack and desktop/laptop allowing for FreeBSD to just work out of the box on most modern laptops
* Enhanced browser and video conferencing capabilities to allow for support on most any contemporary laptop. 
* Significant PF firewall performance improvements, doubling PPS rates in some cases
* 5X if_bridge performance improvements for scalability on multicore systems or multiple VMs
* FreeBSD Network stack and TCP congestion control improvements
* Significant support for RISC-V systems
* Greater ARM64 support for servers and embedded devices like Raspberry Pi 
* Removal of obsolete GPL components. 

Finally, not specific to the 13.0 release, the Project completed the transition from subversion to git making it easier to contribute.   The Project also switched to a new OpenZFS upstream that supports FreeBSD and Linux, resulting in better ZFS collaboration.
